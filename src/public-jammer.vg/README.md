# Jammer (jammer.vg)
Jammer is the standard view of Jammer Core.

Initially it will function as a reskin of Ludum Dare (ludumdare.com), but as things evolve, Jammer will become more Game Jam agnostic. The goal of Ludum Dare (ludumdare.com) is to become more focused on the Ludum Dare event itself, where as the goal of Jammer is not. We still run Ludum Dare, so it'll certainly be highlighted, but as Game Jams and the community around it evolves, Jammer aims to cater to that.

Accounts are "Jammer Accounts", created through jammer.vg (or for convenience, through ludumdare.com).
