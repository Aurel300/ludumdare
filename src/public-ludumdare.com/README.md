# Ludum Dare (ludumdare.com)
Ludum Dare (com) is the focused, Ludum Dare centric view of **Jammer Core**.

Functionally, Jammer (vg) and Ludum Dare (com) are the same. But as things evolve, Ludum Dare (com) will heavily prefer and default to Ludum Dare things (where as Jammer (vg) will become more agnostic).

One of the issues we have is that it can be difficult to understand what Ludum Dare is. You visit our old page, and it's all "What's going on? Is this some blog?".

In time, the landing page will focus on things that brag about Ludum Dare. What it is, news coverage, game releases on Consoles/Steam, etc.

Once logged in, you'll have a standard timeline view (similar to what you're used to). But anyone that is not logged in will get added helper content, and the homepage will look different to them.

Twitter cards and page titles will make reference to upcoming events. Any content-aware website should not require the user to visit ludumdare.com to know something is coming soon.

Accounts created on Ludum Dare (com) are "Jammer Accounts", used across the network of **Jammer Core** websites. User pages will make reference to Jammer.Bio pages.
