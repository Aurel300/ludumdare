# Jammer Bio (jammer.bio)
Jammer Bio is simplified view of Jammer Core, focused on users.

When you create an account on Jammer (vg) or Ludum Dare, you get a Jammer Bio page.

`jammer.bio/my-jammer-account-name` - is your personal homepage.

Design wise, Bio pages should be more streamlined then their Jammer/Ludum Dare counterparts.

* No timeline view
* Content only
  * Games
  * Articles
  * Tools
  * Other items of interest (TBD)

Your Jammer/Ludum Dare user pages will make reference to your bio page, to let you know you have one.

Optionally, use your _Real Name_ on your Bio page, to make it suitable as a portfolio.
