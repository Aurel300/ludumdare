/*
	Summary of this program and its intent:
	
This is an API test for the ludumdare website. It's goal is to interact with all API functionality by simulating a ludumdare.
Users will be created, an event will be created, users will post, read other users posts, post comments, like, etc.
Users will interact with the theme creation process stages, will publish games, will rate each other's games, and will observe the results.
The script will keep track of (some/much of) the data it generates, and will verify that what it sees is what it expects.
(Future) Users will maliciously interact with the API to verify that things cannot be changed (e.g. votes, theme creation) outside of the time when they are enabled to be changed.

The exact flow will be documented in the data structures that guide the process, below.

/*
	Stages definition:
Each stage is a hashtable with a number of properties that are used to determine the behavior in that stage.
Properties:
	Name => Name to display for the stage
	Phases => if present, number indicating how many phases there are to the stage (otherwise just one)
	MaxMinutes => if present, override the time for each phase in this stage to avoid spending a lot of time on it.
	MaxEventsPerUser => if present, impose a hard limit on events per user for each phase in this stage to avoid spending a lot of time on this section.
	StageStart => Function that is called when the stage starts
	StageEnd => Function that is called when the stage ends
	PhaseStart => Function to be called when a phase starts
	PhaseEnd => Function to be called when a phase ends
	
	Always => List of functions (actions) to be called by all simulated users in this phase
	LowChance => List of functions (actions) to be called by a few (at least one, but less than half) of the simulated users in this phase. Each function gets its own list of users
	HighChance => list of functions (actions) to be called by most (not all, but at least half) of the simulated users in this phase. Each function gets its own list of users
	
	UserVerify => Function that is called arbitrarily to ask the system to verify that the data it receives from the website for a specific user is consistent with what it expects.
	
About start/end functions:
	Stage start and end have no argument
	Phase start and end are passed the current phase index as an argument.
	
About actions:
	The action function is always called to ask a specific user to take action.
	The action function is passed a user array, and the phase index.
	if the action function returns false, it will not be called again for that user in that phase. Otherwise it may be called multiple times.
	
About reporting errors:
	TBD
