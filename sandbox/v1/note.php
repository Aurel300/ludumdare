// ** Notes **

// Comments and Messages are notes.

// Direct Messages are comments attached to a user.
// A conversation begins with a comment, and each reply is a child of that main conversation.


// Should comments have weight? i.e. a value suggesting how strong it is (levels deep it goes).
// Need some way to determine where page breaks should be.
// Also need some way to know with private discussion threads, where to cut.
